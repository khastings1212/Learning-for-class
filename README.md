# Learning for class

This is a **learning page** for my class, *learning* how to use github.

## This is a subtitle at level two, this one is a little smaller than number one.
Someone once told me the following quote:

> Don't let your fears stand
> in the way of your dreams.

<ins>This will be underlined</ins>

This will have a ~~strikethrough~~
